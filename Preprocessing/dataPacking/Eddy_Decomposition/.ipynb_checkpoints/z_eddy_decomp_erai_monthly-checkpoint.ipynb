    "Description  : This script serves to decompose the eddy components of the geopotential at 500hPa based on subdaily data. The eddies of Z500 is a good indicator of the behavior of cyclones and many behaviors at midlatitudes. This can provide extra information about the role of transient eddy and stationary eddy when we investigate the meridional energy transport.<br>\n",

    "Caveat!       :  The data used here across subdaily scale. The saving freqeuncy of data is 6 hourly.<br>\n",
    "The procedure is generic and is able to adapt any atmospheric reanalysis datasets, with some changes. Referring to the book \"Physics of Climate\", the concept of decomposition of circulation is given with full details. As a consequence, the meridional energy transport can be decomposed into 4 parts:<br>\n",
